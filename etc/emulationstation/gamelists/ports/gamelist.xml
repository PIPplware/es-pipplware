		<name>Cave Story</name>
		<desc>Arguably the most well-known indie game of all time, Cave Story is an action-adventure game featuring a completely original storyline wrapped with personality, mystery and hours of fast-paced fun. 
You wake up in a dark cave with no memory of who you are, where you came from or why you're in such a place. Uncovering Mimiga Village you discover that the once-carefree Mimigas are in danger at the hands of a maniacal scientist. The Mimigasâ€™ only hope rest squarely on the shoulders of a quiet, amnesiac boy who can't remember his own name.</desc>

		<name>Doom</name>
		<desc>In Doom, a nameless space marine, gets punitively posted to Mars after assaulting a commanding officer, who ordered his unit to fire upon civilians. The Martian marine base acts as security for the Union Aerospace Corporation UAC, a multi-planetary conglomerate, which is performing secret experiments with teleportation by creating gateways between the two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos. Suddenly, one of these UAC experiments goes horribly wrong; computer systems on Phobos malfunction, Deimos disappears entirely and "something fragging evil" starts pouring out of the gateways, killing or possessing all UAC personnel! 
Responding to a frantic distress call from the overrun scientists, the Martian marine unit is quickly sent to Phobos to investigate, where you, the space marine, are left to guard the hangar with only a pistol while the rest of the group proceeds inside to discover their worst nightmare. As you advance further, terrifying screams echo through the vast halls, followed by a disturbing silence ... it seems, all your buddies are dead and you're all on your own now - fight back, exterminate every evil creature and get your ticket back home to earth!</desc>

		<name>Quake III Arena</name>
		<desc>Unlike its predecessors, Q3A does not have a plot-based single-player campaign. Instead, it simulates the multiplayer experience with computer controlled players known as bots. The game's story is brief - 'the greatest warriors of all time fight for the amusement of a race called the Vadrigar in the Arena Eternal.' The introduction video shows the abduction of such a warrior, Sarge, while making a last stand. Continuity with prior games in the Quake series and even Doom is maintained by the inclusion of player models related to those earlier games as well as biographical information included on characters in the manual, a familiar mixture of gothic and technological map architecture and specific equipment; for example, the Quad Damage power-up, the infamous rocket launcher and the BFG super-weapon.</desc>
